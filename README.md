# -Using-Basic-AI-Techniques-to-Solve-Computer-Vision-Problems
# Introduction:
Object recognition, a key problem in computer vision, plays an important 
role in various applications such as e-commerce, surveillance, and social 
media. In this project, we aim to develop an object recognition system 
using artificial intelligence techniques to classify images into different 
classes: Buildings, Food, Others, and People. The system is designed to 
meet the needs of web-based companies looking for automatic image 
analysis for targeted advertising. Using machine intelligence, we aim to 
provide efficient and accurate solutions that improve user experience and 
optimize advertising revenue. Through this project, we explore the 
intersection of artificial intelligence and computer vision, demonstrating the 
power of AI to solve real world problems efficiently and autonomously.
# Dataset description:
The dataset for this project consists of images collected from various 
sources, including the Kaggle database and various websites, to represent 
four different classes: Buildings, People, Food, and more. Each class is 
detailed and separated into separate folders in the database directory 
structure.

# Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
Data preprocessing and augmentation are essential steps in preparing the 
dataset for training a robust object recognition model. In this project, we 
employed various preprocessing techniques to enhance the model's 
performance and generalization ability.
## 1. Rescaling:
Rescaling the pixel values of images to a range between 0 and 1 ensures 
numerical stability during training. Normalizing the data prevents potential 
issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients, leading to more stable 
and efficient model training.
## 2. Data Augmentation:
Data augmentation is a crucial technique used to artificially increase the 
size and diversity of the training dataset, thereby improving the model's 
ability to generalize to unseen data. Several augmentation techniques were 
applied:
##  Rotation Range: Randomly rotating images by a specified angle 
(e.g., 40 degrees) helps the model learn invariant features and 
improves its robustness to variations in object orientation.
##  Width and Height Shift Range: Shifting images horizontally and 
vertically by a certain percentage (e.g., 20%) provides the model with 
additional variations in object position, enhancing its ability to 
recognize objects across different spatial locations.
##  Shear Range: Applying shear transformations introduces 
deformations to the image geometry, simulating perspective changes 
and improving the model's ability to recognize objects from different 
viewpoints.
##  Zoom Range: Randomly zooming into or out of images adds 
variations in scale, enabling the model to detect objects at different 
sizes and distances.
##  Horizontal Flip: Flipping images horizontally introduces mirror 
symmetry, augmenting the dataset with horizontally flipped versions 
of the original images and improving the model's ability to handle 
object orientations.
##  Fill Mode: The choice of fill mode (e.g., 'nearest') determines how 
newly created pixels are filled when applying transformations. This 
parameter ensures that no empty spaces are introduced in the 
augmented images. Model architecture
# Model Architecture
The model architecture employed for object recognition in this project is 
based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), a powerful deep learning 
architecture widely used for image classification tasks. The CNN
architecture comprises several layers designed to extract hierarchical 
features from input images and perform classification based on these 
features.
## Key Components of the Model Architecture:
##  Convolutional Layers:Convolutional layers consist of filters that 
slide over the input images, extracting features through convolutions. 
These layers learn to detect low-level features such as edges and 
textures.
##  Max Pooling Layers:Max pooling layers downsample the feature 
maps obtained from convolutional layers by retaining only the 
maximum values within each local region. This helps reduce the 
spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining the most 
relevant information.
##  Dropout Layers:Dropout layers are used to mitigate overfitting by 
randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training. This 
regularization technique helps prevent the model from relying too 
heavily on specific features, leading to improved generalization 
performance.
##  Dense Layers:Dense layers, also known as fully connected layers, 
are responsible for performing classification based on the extracted 
features. These layers receive flattened feature vectors as input and 
map them to the output classes using activation functions such as 
softmax.
# Model Summary:
The model architecture used in this project consists of multiple 
convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers for feature extraction. 
Dropout regularization is applied to prevent overfitting, and dense layers 
perform classification based on the extracted features. The final layer 
employs a softmax activation function to output class probabilities.
Model training and evaluation
Model training involves optimizing model parameters to minimize the 
selected loss function while simultaneously maximizing performance 
metrics in the training database. After training, the performance of the 
model is evaluated using separate validation and test data to assess its 
generalization ability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
Results and Future recommendations
## 1. Model Performance:
• The trained object recognition model achieved an accuracy of 
approximately 65.84% on the test data set, showing an average 
performance in correctly classifying images.
• However, the performance of the model varied across classes, with high 
accuracy, recall, and F1 scores observed for some classes such as 
Human.
# Future recommendations:
• Data Augmentation: Augmenting the database with additional variables 
and different samples can increase the ability of the model to generalize to 
unseen information and improve its performance across the class.
• Model architecture optimization: Experimenting with different CNN 
architectures, including techniques such as hyper-parameter tuning and 
transfer training, can lead to better classification performance.
• Ensemble learning: By combining predictions from multiple models or 
model variations, implementing ensemble learning techniques can help 
reduce errors and improve overall classification accuracy.
# Conclusion 
In this project, we developed an object recognition 
system using computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to 
analyze images and classify them into four categories: Buildings, Food, 
Other, and People. This project is aimed at meeting the needs of webbased companies that want to customize their sites based on user 
preferences derived from images
